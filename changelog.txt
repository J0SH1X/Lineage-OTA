    dm era: Update in-core bitset after committing the metadata
    
    commit 2099b145d77c1d53f5711f029c37cc537897cee6 upstream.
    
    In case of a system crash, dm-era might fail to mark blocks as written
    in its metadata, although the corresponding writes to these blocks were
    passed down to the origin device and completed successfully.
    
    Consider the following sequence of events:
    
    1. We write to a block that has not been yet written in the current era
    2. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap for the current era and sees
       that the block is not marked as written.
    3. The write is deferred for submission after the metadata have been
       updated and committed.
    4. The worker thread processes the deferred write
       (process_deferred_bios()) and marks the block as written in the
       in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    5. The worker thread starts committing the metadata.
    6. We do more writes that map to the same block as the write of step (1)
    7. era_map() checks the in-core bitmap and sees that the block is marked
       as written, **although the metadata have not been committed yet**.
    8. These writes are passed down to the origin device immediately and the
       device reports them as completed.
    9. The system crashes, e.g., power failure, before the commit from step
       (5) finishes.
    
    When the system recovers and we query the dm-era target for the list of
    written blocks it doesn't report the aforementioned block as written,
    although the writes of step (6) completed successfully.
    
    The issue is that era_map() decides whether to defer or not a write
    based on non committed information. The root cause of the bug is that we
    update the in-core bitmap, **before** committing the metadata.
    
    Fix this by updating the in-core bitmap **after** successfully
    committing the metadata.

    net: icmp: pass zeroed opts from icmp{,v6}_ndo_send before sending
    
    commit ee576c47db60432c37e54b1e2b43a8ca6d3a8dca upstream.
    
    The icmp{,v6}_send functions make all sorts of use of skb->cb, casting
    it with IPCB or IP6CB, assuming the skb to have come directly from the
    inet layer. But when the packet comes from the ndo layer, especially
    when forwarded, there's no telling what might be in skb->cb at that
    point. As a result, the icmp sending code risks reading bogus memory
    contents, which can result in nasty stack overflows such as this one
    reported by a user:
    
        panic+0x108/0x2ea
        __stack_chk_fail+0x14/0x20
        __icmp_send+0x5bd/0x5c0
        icmp_ndo_send+0x148/0x160
    
    In icmp_send, skb->cb is cast with IPCB and an ip_options struct is read
    from it. The optlen parameter there is of particular note, as it can
    induce writes beyond bounds. There are quite a few ways that can happen
    in __ip_options_echo. For example:
    
        // sptr/skb are attacker-controlled skb bytes
        sptr = skb_network_header(skb);
        // dptr/dopt points to stack memory allocated by __icmp_send
        dptr = dopt->__data;
        // sopt is the corrupt skb->cb in question
        if (sopt->rr) {
            optlen  = sptr[sopt->rr+1]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            soffset = sptr[sopt->rr+2]; // corrupt skb->cb + skb->data
            // this now writes potentially attacker-controlled data, over
            // flowing the stack:
            memcpy(dptr, sptr+sopt->rr, optlen);
        }
    
    In the icmpv6_send case, the story is similar, but not as dire, as only
    IP6CB(skb)->iif and IP6CB(skb)->dsthao are used. The dsthao case is
    worse than the iif case, but it is passed to ipv6_find_tlv, which does
    a bit of bounds checking on the value.
    
    This is easy to simulate by doing a `memset(skb->cb, 0x41,
    sizeof(skb->cb));` before calling icmp{,v6}_ndo_send, and it's only by
    good fortune and the rarity of icmp sending from that context that we've
    avoided reports like this until now. For example, in KASAN:
    
        BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in __ip_options_echo+0xa0e/0x12b0
        Write of size 38 at addr ffff888006f1f80e by task ping/89
        CPU: 2 PID: 89 Comm: ping Not tainted 5.10.0-rc7-debug+ #5
        Call Trace:
         dump_stack+0x9a/0xcc
         print_address_description.constprop.0+0x1a/0x160
         __kasan_report.cold+0x20/0x38
         kasan_report+0x32/0x40
         check_memory_region+0x145/0x1a0
         memcpy+0x39/0x60
         __ip_options_echo+0xa0e/0x12b0
         __icmp_send+0x744/0x1700
    
    Actually, out of the 4 drivers that do this, only gtp zeroed the cb for
    the v4 case, while the rest did not. So this commit actually removes the
    gtp-specific zeroing, while putting the code where it belongs in the
    shared infrastructure of icmp{,v6}_ndo_send.
    
    This commit fixes the issue by passing an empty IPCB or IP6CB along to
    the functions that actually do the work. For the icmp_send, this was
    already trivial, thanks to __icmp_send providing the plumbing function.
    For icmpv6_send, this required a tiny bit of refactoring to make it
    behave like the v4 case, after which it was straight forward.

    commit 67c9a7e1e3ac491b5df018803639addc36f154ba upstream.
    
    Because sunvnet is calling icmp from network device context, it should use
    the ndo helper so that the rate limiting applies correctly. While we're
    at it, doing the additional route lookup before calling icmp_ndo_send is
    superfluous, since this is the job of the icmp code in the first place.

    icmp: allow icmpv6_ndo_send to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n
    
    commit a8e41f6033a0c5633d55d6e35993c9e2005d872f upstream.
    
    The icmpv6_send function has long had a static inline implementation
    with an empty body for CONFIG_IPV6=n, so that code calling it doesn't
    need to be ifdef'd. The new icmpv6_ndo_send function, which is intended
    for drivers as a drop-in replacement with an identical function
    signature, should follow the same pattern. Without this patch, drivers
    that used to work with CONFIG_IPV6=n now result in a linker error.

    dm era: only resize metadata in preresume
    
    commit cca2c6aebe86f68103a8615074b3578e854b5016 upstream.
    
    Metadata resize shouldn't happen in the ctr. The ctr loads a temporary
    (inactive) table that will only become active upon resume. That is why
    resize should always be done in terms of resume. Otherwise a load (ctr)
    whose inactive table never becomes active will incorrectly resize the
    metadata.
    
    Also, perform the resize directly in preresume, instead of using the
    worker to do it.
    
    The worker might run other metadata operations, e.g., it could start
    digestion, before resizing the metadata. These operations will end up
    using the old size.
    
    This could lead to errors, like:
    
      device-mapper: era: metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset: dm_array_set_value failed
      device-mapper: era: process_old_eras: digest step failed, stopping digestion
    
    The reason of the above error is that the worker started the digestion
    of the archived writeset using the old, larger size.
    
    As a result, metadata_digest_transcribe_writeset tried to write beyond
    the end of the era array.

    dm era: Reinitialize bitset cache before digesting a new writeset
    
    commit 2524933307fd0036d5c32357c693c021ab09a0b0 upstream.
    
    In case of devices with at most 64 blocks, the digestion of consecutive
    eras uses the writeset of the first era as the writeset of all eras to
    digest, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the information about
    what blocks were written during the affected eras.
    
    The digestion code uses a dm_disk_bitset object to access the archived
    writesets. This structure includes a one word (64-bit) cache to reduce
    the number of array lookups.
    
    This structure is initialized only once, in metadata_digest_start(),
    when we kick off digestion.
    
    But, when we insert a new writeset into the writeset tree, before the
    digestion of the previous writeset is done, or equivalently when there
    are multiple writesets in the writeset tree to digest, then all these
    writesets are digested using the same cache and the cache is not
    re-initialized when moving from one writeset to the next.
    
    For devices with more than 64 blocks, i.e., the size of the cache, the
    cache is indirectly invalidated when we move to a next set of blocks, so
    we avoid the bug.
    
    But for devices with at most 64 blocks we end up using the same cached
    data for digesting all archived writesets, i.e., the cache is loaded
    when digesting the first writeset and it never gets reloaded, until the
    digestion is done.
    
    As a result, the writeset of the first era to digest is used as the
    writeset of all the following archived eras, leading to lost writes.
    
    Fix this by reinitializing the dm_disk_bitset structure, and thus
    invalidating the cache, every time the digestion code starts digesting a
    new writeset.

    dm era: Recover committed writeset after crash
    
    commit de89afc1e40fdfa5f8b666e5d07c43d21a1d3be0 upstream.
    
    Following a system crash, dm-era fails to recover the committed writeset
    for the current era, leading to lost writes. That is, we lose the
    information about what blocks were written during the affected era.
    
    dm-era assumes that the writeset of the current era is archived when the
    device is suspended. So, when resuming the device, it just moves on to
    the next era, ignoring the committed writeset.
    
    This assumption holds when the device is properly shut down. But, when
    the system crashes, the code that suspends the target never runs, so the
    writeset for the current era is not archived.
    
    There are three issues that cause the committed writeset to get lost:
    
    1. dm-era doesn't load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. The code that resizes the metadata wipes the information about the
       committed writeset (assuming it was loaded at step 1)
    3. era_preresume() starts a new era, without taking into account that
       the current era might not have been archived, due to a system crash.
    
    To fix this:
    
    1. Load the committed writeset when opening the metadata
    2. Fix the code that resizes the metadata to make sure it doesn't wipe
       the loaded writeset
    3. Fix era_preresume() to check for a loaded writeset and archive it,
       before starting a new era.

    gfs2: Don't skip dlm unlock if glock has an lvb
    
    commit 78178ca844f0eb88f21f31c7fde969384be4c901 upstream.
    
    Patch fb6791d100d1 was designed to allow gfs2 to unmount quicker by
    skipping the step where it tells dlm to unlock glocks in EX with lvbs.
    This was done because when gfs2 unmounts a file system, it destroys the
    dlm lockspace shortly after it destroys the glocks so it doesn't need to
    unlock them all: the unlock is implied when the lockspace is destroyed
    by dlm.
    
    However, that patch introduced a use-after-free in dlm: as part of its
    normal dlm_recoverd process, it can call ls_recovery to recover dead
    locks. In so doing, it can call recover_rsbs which calls recover_lvb for
    any mastered rsbs. Func recover_lvb runs through the list of lkbs queued
    to the given rsb (if the glock is cached but unlocked, it will still be
    queued to the lkb, but in NL--Unlocked--mode) and if it has an lvb,
    copies it to the rsb, thus trying to preserve the lkb. However, when
    gfs2 skips the dlm unlock step, it frees the glock and its lvb, which
    means dlm's function recover_lvb references the now freed lvb pointer,
    copying the freed lvb memory to the rsb.
    
    This patch changes the check in gdlm_put_lock so that it calls
    dlm_unlock for all glocks that contain an lvb pointer.

    sparc32: fix a user-triggerable oops in clear_user()
    
    commit 7780918b36489f0b2f9a3749d7be00c2ceaec513 upstream.
    
    Back in 2.1.29 the clear_user() guts (__bzero()) had been merged
    with memset().  Unfortunately, while all exception handlers had been
    copied, one of the exception table entries got lost.  As the result,
    clear_user() starting at 128*n bytes before the end of page and
    spanning between 8 and 127 bytes into the next page would oops when
    the second page is unmapped.  It's trivial to reproduce - all
    it takes is
    
    main()
    {
            int fd = open("/dev/zero", O_RDONLY);
            char *p = mmap(NULL, 16384, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                            MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON, -1, 0);
            munmap(p + 8192, 8192);
            read(fd, p + 8192 - 128, 192);
    }
    
    which had been oopsing since March 1997.  Says something about
    the quality of test coverage... ;-/  And while today sparc32 port
    is nearly dead, back in '97 it had been very much alive; in fact,
    sparc64 had only been in mainline for 3 months by that point...

    printk: fix deadlock when kernel panic
    
    commit 8a8109f303e25a27f92c1d8edd67d7cbbc60a4eb upstream.
    
    printk_safe_flush_on_panic() caused the following deadlock on our
    server:
    
    CPU0:                                         CPU1:
    panic                                         rcu_dump_cpu_stacks
      kdump_nmi_shootdown_cpus                      nmi_trigger_cpumask_backtrace
        register_nmi_handler(crash_nmi_callback)      printk_safe_flush
                                                        __printk_safe_flush
                                                          raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
        // send NMI to other processors
        apic_send_IPI_allbutself(NMI_VECTOR)
                                                            // NMI interrupt, dead loop
                                                            crash_nmi_callback
      printk_safe_flush_on_panic
        printk_safe_flush
          __printk_safe_flush
            // deadlock
            raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&read_lock)
    
    DEADLOCK: read_lock is taken on CPU1 and will never get released.
    
    It happens when panic() stops a CPU by NMI while it has been in
    the middle of printk_safe_flush().
    
    Handle the lock the same way as logbuf_lock. The printk_safe buffers
    are flushed only when both locks can be safely taken. It can avoid
    the deadlock _in this particular case_ at expense of losing contents
    of printk_safe buffers.
    
    Note: It would actually be safe to re-init the locks when all CPUs were
          stopped by NMI. But it would require passing this information
          from arch-specific code. It is not worth the complexity.
          Especially because logbuf_lock and printk_safe buffers have been
          obsoleted by the lockless ring buffer.

    gpio: pcf857x: Fix missing first interrupt
    
    commit a8002a35935aaefcd6a42ad3289f62bab947f2ca upstream.
    
    If no n_latch value will be provided at driver probe then all pins will
    be used as an input:
    
        gpio->out = ~n_latch;
    
    In that case initial state for all pins is "one":
    
        gpio->status = gpio->out;
    
    So if pcf857x IRQ happens with change pin value from "zero" to "one"
    then we miss it, because of "one" from IRQ and "one" from initial state
    leaves corresponding pin unchanged:
    change = (gpio->status ^ status) & gpio->irq_enabled;
    
    The right solution will be to read actual state at driver probe.

    mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix kernel panic when remove module
    
    commit a56f44138a2c57047f1ea94ea121af31c595132b upstream.
    
    In sdhci_esdhc_imx_remove() the SDHCI_INT_STATUS in read. Under some
    circumstances, this may be done while the device is runtime suspended,
    triggering the below splat.
    
    Fix the problem by adding a pm_runtime_get_sync(), before reading the
    register, which will turn on clocks etc making the device accessible again.

    module: Ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ when warning for undefined symbols
    
    commit ebfac7b778fac8b0e8e92ec91d0b055f046b4604 upstream.
    
    clang-12 -fno-pic (since
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/a084c0388e2a59b9556f2de0083333232da3f1d6)
    can emit `call __stack_chk_fail@PLT` instead of `call __stack_chk_fail`
    on x86.  The two forms should have identical behaviors on x86-64 but the
    former causes GNU as<2.37 to produce an unreferenced undefined symbol
    _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_.
    
    (On x86-32, there is an R_386_PC32 vs R_386_PLT32 difference but the
    linker behavior is identical as far as Linux kernel is concerned.)
    
    Simply ignore _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ for now, like what
    scripts/mod/modpost.c:ignore_undef_symbol does. This also fixes the
    problem for gcc/clang -fpie and -fpic, which may emit `call foo@PLT` for
    external function calls on x86.
    
    Note: ld -z defs and dynamic loaders do not error for unreferenced
    undefined symbols so the module loader is reading too much.  If we ever
    need to ignore more symbols, the code should be refactored to ignore
    unreferenced symbols.

    mm: hugetlb: fix a race between freeing and dissolving the page
    
    commit 7ffddd499ba6122b1a07828f023d1d67629aa017 upstream
    
    There is a race condition between __free_huge_page()
    and dissolve_free_huge_page().
    
      CPU0:                         CPU1:
    
      // page_count(page) == 1
      put_page(page)
        __free_huge_page(page)
                                    dissolve_free_huge_page(page)
                                      spin_lock(&hugetlb_lock)
                                      // PageHuge(page) && !page_count(page)
                                      update_and_free_page(page)
                                      // page is freed to the buddy
                                      spin_unlock(&hugetlb_lock)
          spin_lock(&hugetlb_lock)
          clear_page_huge_active(page)
          enqueue_huge_page(page)
          // It is wrong, the page is already freed
          spin_unlock(&hugetlb_lock)
    
    The race window is between put_page() and dissolve_free_huge_page().
    
    We should make sure that the page is already on the free list when it is
    dissolved.
    
    As a result __free_huge_page would corrupt page(s) already in the buddy
    allocator.

    hugetlb: fix copy_huge_page_from_user contig page struct assumption
    
    commit 3272cfc2525b3a2810a59312d7a1e6f04a0ca3ef upstream.
    
    page structs are not guaranteed to be contiguous for gigantic pages.  The
    routine copy_huge_page_from_user can encounter gigantic pages, yet it
    assumes page structs are contiguous when copying pages from user space.
    
    Since page structs for the target gigantic page are not contiguous, the
    data copied from user space could overwrite other pages not associated
    with the gigantic page and cause data corruption.
    
    Non-contiguous page structs are generally not an issue.  However, they can
    exist with a specific kernel configuration and hotplug operations.  For
    example: Configure the kernel with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM and
    !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP.  Then, hotplug add memory for the area where
    the gigantic page will be allocated.

    watchdog: mei_wdt: request stop on unregister
    
    commit 740c0a57b8f1e36301218bf549f3c9cc833a60be upstream.
    
    The MEI bus has a special behavior on suspend it destroys
    all the attached devices, this is due to the fact that also
    firmware context is not persistent across power flows.
    
    If watchdog on MEI bus is ticking before suspending the firmware
    times out and reports that the OS is missing watchdog tick.
    Send the stop command to the firmware on watchdog unregistered
    to eliminate the false event on suspend.
    This does not make the things worse from the user-space perspective
    as a user-space should re-open watchdog device after
    suspending before this patch.

    floppy: reintroduce O_NDELAY fix
    
    commit 8a0c014cd20516ade9654fc13b51345ec58e7be8 upstream.
    
    This issue was originally fixed in 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open()
    flags handling").
    
    The fix as a side-effect, however, introduce issue for open(O_ACCMODE)
    that is being used for ioctl-only open. I wrote a fix for that, but
    instead of it being merged, full revert of 09954bad4 was performed,
    re-introducing the O_NDELAY / O_NONBLOCK issue, and it strikes again.
    
    This is a forward-port of the original fix to current codebase; the
    original submission had the changelog below:
    
    ====
    Commit 09954bad4 ("floppy: refactor open() flags handling"), as a
    side-effect, causes open(/dev/fdX, O_ACCMODE) to fail. It turns out that
    this is being used setfdprm userspace for ioctl-only open().
    
    Reintroduce back the original behavior wrt !(FMODE_READ|FMODE_WRITE)
    modes, while still keeping the original O_NDELAY bug fixed.

    x86/reboot: Force all cpus to exit VMX root if VMX is supported
    
    commit ed72736183c45a413a8d6974dd04be90f514cb6b upstream.
    
    Force all CPUs to do VMXOFF (via NMI shootdown) during an emergency
    reboot if VMX is _supported_, as VMX being off on the current CPU does
    not prevent other CPUs from being in VMX root (post-VMXON).  This fixes
    a bug where a crash/panic reboot could leave other CPUs in VMX root and
    prevent them from being woken via INIT-SIPI-SIPI in the new kernel.

    buffer named "cow" we previously allocated with btrfs_alloc_tree_block().
    
    So fix that by unlocking the extent buffer and dropping our reference on
    it before returning.

    btrfs: fix reloc root leak with 0 ref reloc roots on recovery
    
    commit c78a10aebb275c38d0cfccae129a803fe622e305 upstream.
    
    When recovering a relocation, if we run into a reloc root that has 0
    refs we simply add it to the reloc_control->reloc_roots list, and then
    clean it up later.  The problem with this is __del_reloc_root() doesn't
    do anything if the root isn't in the radix tree, which in this case it
    won't be because we never call __add_reloc_root() on the reloc_root.
    
    This exit condition simply isn't correct really.  During normal
    operation we can remove ourselves from the rb tree and then we're meant
    to clean up later at merge_reloc_roots() time, and this happens
    correctly.  During recovery we're depending on free_reloc_roots() to
    drop our references, but we're short-circuiting.
    
    Fix this by continuing to check if we're on the list and dropping
    ourselves from the reloc_control root list and dropping our reference
    appropriately.  Change the corresponding BUG_ON() to an ASSERT() that
    does the correct thing if we aren't in the rb tree.

    btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to inc ref in btrfs_copy_root
    
    commit 867ed321f90d06aaba84e2c91de51cd3038825ef upstream.
    
    While testing my error handling patches, I added a error injection site
    at btrfs_inc_extent_ref, to validate the error handling I added was
    doing the correct thing.  However I hit a pretty ugly corruption while
    doing this check, with the following error injection stack trace:
    
    btrfs_inc_extent_ref
      btrfs_copy_root
        create_reloc_root
          btrfs_init_reloc_root
            btrfs_record_root_in_trans
              btrfs_start_transaction
                btrfs_update_inode
                  btrfs_update_time
                    touch_atime
                      file_accessed
                        btrfs_file_mmap
    
    This is because we do not catch the error from btrfs_inc_extent_ref,
    which in practice would be ENOMEM, which means we lose the extent
    references for a root that has already been allocated and inserted,
    which is the problem.  Fix this by aborting the transaction if we fail
    to do the reference modification.

    KEYS: trusted: Fix migratable=1 failing
    
    commit 8da7520c80468c48f981f0b81fc1be6599e3b0ad upstream.
    
    Consider the following transcript:
    
    $ keyctl add trusted kmk "new 32 blobauth=helloworld keyhandle=80000000 migratable=1" @u
    add_key: Invalid argument
    
    The documentation has the following description:
    
      migratable=   0|1 indicating permission to reseal to new PCR values,
                    default 1 (resealing allowed)
    
    The consequence is that "migratable=1" should succeed. Fix this by
    allowing this condition to pass instead of return -EINVAL.

    tpm_tis: Fix check_locality for correct locality acquisition
    
    commit 3d9ae54af1d02a7c0edc55c77d7df2b921e58a87 upstream.
    
    The TPM TIS specification says the TPM signals the acquisition of locality
    when the TMP_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to one *and* the
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE bit goes to zero.  Currently we only check the
    former not the latter, so check both.  Adding the check on
    TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should fix the case where the locality is
    re-requested before the TPM has released it.  In this case the locality may
    get released briefly before it is reacquired, which causes all sorts of
    problems. However, with the added check, TPM_ACCESS_REQUEST_USE should
    remain 1 until the second request for the locality is granted.

    usb: musb: Fix runtime PM race in musb_queue_resume_work
    
    commit 0eaa1a3714db34a59ce121de5733c3909c529463 upstream.
    
    musb_queue_resume_work() would call the provided callback if the runtime
    PM status was 'active'. Otherwise, it would enqueue the request if the
    hardware was still suspended (musb->is_runtime_suspended is true).
    
    This causes a race with the runtime PM handlers, as it is possible to be
    in the case where the runtime PM status is not yet 'active', but the
    hardware has been awaken (PM resume function has been called).
    
    When hitting the race, the resume work was not enqueued, which probably
    triggered other bugs further down the stack. For instance, a telnet
    connection on Ingenic SoCs would result in a 50/50 chance of a
    segmentation fault somewhere in the musb code.
    
    Rework the code so that either we call the callback directly if
    (musb->is_runtime_suspended == 0), or enqueue the query otherwise.

    USB: serial: option: update interface mapping for ZTE P685M
    
    commit 6420a569504e212d618d4a4736e2c59ed80a8478 upstream.
    
    This patch prepares for qmi_wwan driver support for the device.
    Previously "option" driver mapped itself to interfaces 0 and 3 (matching
    ff/ff/ff), while interface 3 is in fact a QMI port.
    Interfaces 1 and 2 (matching ff/00/00) expose AT commands,
    and weren't supported previously at all.
    Without this patch, a possible conflict would exist if device ID was
    added to qmi_wwan driver for interface 3.
    
    Update and simplify device ID to match interfaces 0-2 directly,
    to expose QCDM (0), PCUI (1), and modem (2) ports and avoid conflict
    with QMI (3), and ADB (4).
    
    The modem is used inside ZTE MF283+ router and carriers identify it as
    such.
    Interface mapping is:
    0: QCDM, 1: AT (PCUI), 2: AT (Modem), 3: QMI, 4: ADB

    commit b5d6e7ab7fe7d186878142e9fc1a05e4c3b65eb9 upstream.
    
    After commit 77b425399f6d ("Input: i8042 - use chassis info to skip
    selftest on Asus laptops"), all modern Asus laptops have the i8042
    selftest disabled. It has done by using chassys type "10" (laptop).
    
    The Asus Zenbook Flip suffers from similar suspend/resume issues, but
    it _sometimes_ work and sometimes it doesn't. Setting noselftest makes
    it work reliably. In this case, we need to add chassis type "31"
    (convertible) in order to avoid selftest in this device.

    HID: wacom: Ignore attempts to overwrite the touch_max value from HID
    
    commit 88f38846bfb1a452a3d47e38aeab20a4ceb74294 upstream.
    
    The `wacom_feature_mapping` function is careful to only set the the
    touch_max value a single time, but this care does not extend to the
    `wacom_wac_finger_event` function. In particular, if a device sends
    multiple HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items in a single feature report, the
    driver will end up retaining the value of last item.
    
    The HID descriptor for the Cintiq Companion 2 does exactly this. It
    incorrectly sets a "Report Count" of 2, which will cause the driver
    to process two HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT items. The first item has the actual
    count, while the second item should have been declared as a constant
    zero. The constant zero is the value the driver ends up using, however,
    since it is the last HID_DG_CONTACTCOUNT in the report.
    
        Report ID (16),
        Usage (Contact Count Maximum),  ; Contact count maximum (55h, static value)
        Report Count (2),
        Logical Maximum (10),
        Feature (Variable),
    
    To address this, we add a check that the touch_max is not already set
    within the `wacom_wac_finger_event` function that processes the
    HID_DG_TOUCHMAX item. We emit a warning if the value is set and ignore
    the updated value.
    
    This could potentially cause problems if there is a tablet which has
    a similar issue but requires the last item to be used. This is unlikely,
    however, since it would have to have a different non-zero value for
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX earlier in the same report, which makes no sense
    except in the case of a firmware bug. Note that cases where the
    HID_DG_CONTACTMAX items are in different reports is already handled
    (and similarly ignored) by `wacom_feature_mapping` as mentioned above.

    ACPI: property: Fix fwnode string properties matching
    
    commit e1e6bd2995ac0e1ad0c2a2d906a06f59ce2ed293 upstream.
    
    Property matching does not work for ACPI fwnodes if the value of the
    given property is not represented as a package in the _DSD package
    containing it.  For example, the "compatible" property in the _DSD
    below
    
      Name (_DSD, Package () {
        ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
        Package () {
          Package () {"compatible", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45"}
        }
      })
    
    will not be found by fwnode_property_match_string(), because the ACPI
    code handling device properties does not regard the single value as a
    "list" in that case.
    
    Namely, fwnode_property_match_string() invoked to match a given
    string property value first calls fwnode_property_read_string_array()
    with the last two arguments equal to NULL and 0, respectively, in
    order to count the items in the value of the given property, with the
    assumption that this value may be an array.  For ACPI fwnodes, that
    operation is carried out by acpi_node_prop_read() which calls
    acpi_data_prop_read() for this purpose.  However, when the return
    (val) pointer is NULL, that function only looks for a property whose
    value is a package without checking the single-value case at all.
    
    To fix that, make acpi_data_prop_read() check the single-value
    case if its return pointer argument is NULL and modify
    acpi_data_prop_read_single() handling that case to attempt to
    read the value of the property if the return pointer is NULL
    and return 1 if that succeeds.

    blk-settings: align max_sectors on "logical_block_size" boundary
    
    commit 97f433c3601a24d3513d06f575a389a2ca4e11e4 upstream.
    
    We get I/O errors when we run md-raid1 on the top of dm-integrity on the
    top of ramdisk.
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xff00, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0xffff, 0x1
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8048, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8147, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8246, 0xff
    device-mapper: integrity: Bio not aligned on 8 sectors: 0x8345, 0xbb
    
    The ramdisk device has logical_block_size 512 and max_sectors 255. The
    dm-integrity device uses logical_block_size 4096 and it doesn't affect the
    "max_sectors" value - thus, it inherits 255 from the ramdisk. So, we have
    a device with max_sectors not aligned on logical_block_size.
    
    The md-raid device sees that the underlying leg has max_sectors 255 and it
    will split the bios on 255-sector boundary, making the bios unaligned on
    logical_block_size.
    
    In order to fix the bug, we round down max_sectors to logical_block_size.

    mm/rmap: fix potential pte_unmap on an not mapped pte

    For PMD-mapped page (usually THP), pvmw->pte is NULL.  For PTE-mapped THP,
    pvmw->pte is mapped.  But for HugeTLB pages, pvmw->pte is not mapped and
    set to the relevant page table entry.  So in page_vma_mapped_walk_done(),
    we may do pte_unmap() for HugeTLB pte which is not mapped.  Fix this by
    checking pvmw->page against PageHuge before trying to do pte_unmap().

    Although there has been a bit of back and forth on the subject, it
    appears that invalidating TLBs requires an ISB instruction when FEAT_ETS
    is not implemented by the CPU.
    
    From the bible:
    
      | In an implementation that does not implement FEAT_ETS, a TLB
      | maintenance instruction executed by a PE, PEx, can complete at any
      | time after it is issued, but is only guaranteed to be finished for a
      | PE, PEx, after the execution of DSB by the PEx followed by a Context
      | synchronization event
    
    Add the missing ISB in __primary_switch, just in case.

    i40e: Fix flow for IPv6 next header (extension header)
    
    [ Upstream commit 92c6058024e87087cf1b99b0389d67c0a886360e ]
    
    When a packet contains an IPv6 header with next header which is
    an extension header and not a protocol one, the kernel function
    skb_transport_header called with such sk_buff will return a
    pointer to the extension header and not to the TCP one.
    
    The above explained call caused a problem with packet processing
    for skb with encapsulation for tunnel with I40E_TX_CTX_EXT_IP_IPV6.
    The extension header was not skipped at all.
    
    The ipv6_skip_exthdr function does check if next header of the IPV6
    header is an extension header and doesn't modify the l4_proto pointer
    if it points to a protocol header value so its safe to omit the
    comparison of exthdr and l4.hdr pointers. The ipv6_skip_exthdr can
    return value -1. This means that the skipping process failed
    and there is something wrong with the packet so it will be dropped.

    ext4: fix potential htree index checksum corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit b5776e7524afbd4569978ff790864755c438bba7 ]
    
    In the case where we need to do an interior node split, and
    immediately afterwards, we are unable to allocate a new directory leaf
    block due to ENOSPC, the directory index checksum's will not be filled
    in correctly (and indeed, will not be correctly journalled).
    
    This looks like a bug that was introduced when we added largedir
    support.  The original code doesn't make any sense (and should have
    been caught in code review), but it was hidden because most of the
    time, the index node checksum will be set by do_split().  But if
    do_split bails out due to ENOSPC, then ext4_handle_dirty_dx_node()
    won't get called, and so the directory index checksum field will not
    get set, leading to:
    
    EXT4-fs error (device sdb): dx_probe:858: inode #6635543: block 4022: comm nfsd: Directory index failed checksum

    PCI: Align checking of syscall user config accessors

    After 34e3207205ef ("PCI: handle positive error codes"),
    pci_user_read_config_*() and pci_user_write_config_*() return 0 or negative

    PCIBIOS_BAD_REGISTER_NUMBER.
    
    Remove comparisons with PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL and check only for non-zero.  It
    happens that PCIBIOS_SUCCESSFUL is zero, so this is not a functional
    change, but it aligns this code with the user accessors.

    If rockchip_pwm_probe() fails to register a PWM device it calls
    clk_unprepare() for the device's PWM clock, without having first disabled
    the clock and before jumping to an error handler that also unprepares
    it. This is likely to produce warnings from the kernel about the clock
    being unprepared when it is still enabled, and then being unprepared when
    it has already been unprepared.
    
    Prevent these warnings by removing this unnecessary call to
    clk_unprepare().

    dlpar_configure_connector() has two problems in its handling of

    1. When the status is -2 (busy, call again), we call
       ibm,configure-connector again immediately without checking whether
       to schedule, which can result in monopolizing the CPU.
    2. Extended delay status (9900..9905) goes completely unhandled,
       causing the configuration to unnecessarily terminate.
    
    Fix both of these issues by using rtas_busy_delay().

    perf tools: Fix DSO filtering when not finding a map for a sampled address
    
    [ Upstream commit c69bf11ad3d30b6bf01cfa538ddff1a59467c734 ]
    
    When we lookup an address and don't find a map we should filter that
    sample if the user specified a list of --dso entries to filter on, fix
    it.
    
    Before:
    
      $ perf script
                 sleep 274800  2843.556162:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556168:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b047d [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556171:          1 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2706b2 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556174:          6 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b0267 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556176:         59 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb2b03b1 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556180:        691 cycles:u:  ffffffffbb26bff4 [unknown] ([unknown])
                 sleep 274800  2843.556189:       9160 cycles:u:      7fa9550eeaa3 __GI___tunables_init+0xf3 (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
                 sleep 274800  2843.556312:      86937 cycles:u:      7fa9550e157b _dl_lookup_symbol_x+0x4b (/usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so)
      $
    
    So we have some samples we somehow didn't find in a map for, if we now
    do:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      #
      # Total Lost Samples: 0
      #
      # Samples: 8  of event 'cycles:u'
      # Event count (approx.): 96856
      #
      # Overhead  Command  Symbol
      # ........  .......  ........................
      #
          89.76%  sleep    [.] _dl_lookup_symbol_x
           9.46%  sleep    [.] __GI___tunables_init
           0.71%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb26bff4
           0.06%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b03b1
           0.01%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b0267
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2706b2
           0.00%  sleep    [k] 0xffffffffbb2b047d
      $
    
    After this patch we get the right output with just entries for the DSOs
    specified in --dso:
    
      $ perf report --stdio --dso /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      # dso: /usr/lib64/ld-2.32.so
      #

    tracepoint: Do not fail unregistering a probe due to memory failure
    
    [ Upstream commit befe6d946551d65cddbd32b9cb0170b0249fd5ed ]
    
    The list of tracepoint callbacks is managed by an array that is protected
    by RCU. To update this array, a new array is allocated, the updates are
    copied over to the new array, and then the list of functions for the
    tracepoint is switched over to the new array. After a completion of an RCU
    grace period, the old array is freed.
    
    This process happens for both adding a callback as well as removing one.
    But on removing a callback, if the new array fails to be allocated, the
    callback is not removed, and may be used after it is freed by the clients
    of the tracepoint.
    
    There's really no reason to fail if the allocation for a new array fails
    when removing a function. Instead, the function can simply be replaced by a
    stub function that could be cleaned up on the next modification of the
    array. That is, instead of calling the function registered to the
    tracepoint, it would call a stub function in its place.

    Link: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20201118093405.7a6d2290@gandalf.local.home
    
    [ Note, this version does use undefined compiler behavior (assuming that
      a stub function with no parameters or return, can be called by a location
      that thinks it has parameters but still no return value. Static calls
      do the same thing, so this trick is not without precedent.
    
      There's another solution that uses RCU tricks and is more complex, but
      can be an alternative if this solution becomes an issue.

    amba: Fix resource leak for drivers without .remove
    
    [ Upstream commit de5d7adb89367bbc87b4e5ce7afe7ae9bd86dc12 ]
    
    Consider an amba driver with a .probe but without a .remove callback (e.g.
    pl061_gpio_driver). The function amba_probe() is called to bind a device
    and so dev_pm_domain_attach() and others are called. As there is no remove
    callback amba_remove() isn't called at unbind time however and so calling
    dev_pm_domain_detach() is missed and the pm domain keeps active.
    
    To fix this always use the core driver callbacks and handle missing amba
    callbacks there. For probe refuse registration as a driver without probe
    doesn't make sense.

    ARM: 9046/1: decompressor: Do not clear SCTLR.nTLSMD for ARMv7+ cores
    
    [ Upstream commit 2acb909750431030b65a0a2a17fd8afcbd813a84 ]
    
    It was observed that decompressor running on hardware implementing ARM v8.2
    Load/Store Multiple Atomicity and Ordering Control (LSMAOC), say, as guest,
    would stuck just after:
    
    Uncompressing Linux... done, booting the kernel.
    
    The reason is that it clears nTLSMD bit when disabling caches:
    
      nTLSMD, bit [3]
    
      When ARMv8.2-LSMAOC is implemented:
    
        No Trap Load Multiple and Store Multiple to
        Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory.
    
        0b0 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are trapped and
            generate a stage 1 Alignment fault.
    
        0b1 All memory accesses by A32 and T32 Load Multiple and Store
            Multiple at EL1 or EL0 that are marked at stage 1 as
            Device-nGRE/Device-nGnRE/Device-nGnRnE memory are not trapped.
    
      This bit is permitted to be cached in a TLB.
    
      This field resets to 1.
    
      Otherwise:
    
      Reserved, RES1
    
    So as effect we start getting traps we are not quite ready for.
    
    Looking into history it seems that mask used for SCTLR clear came from
    the similar code for ARMv4, where bit[3] is the enable/disable bit for
    the write buffer. That not applicable to ARMv7 and onwards, so retire
    that bit from the masks.

    certs: Fix blacklist flag type confusion
    
    [ Upstream commit 4993e1f9479a4161fd7d93e2b8b30b438f00cb0f ]
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is not meant to be passed to keyring_alloc() or key_alloc(),
    as these only take KEY_ALLOC_* flags.  KEY_FLAG_KEEP has the same value as
    KEY_ALLOC_BYPASS_RESTRICTION, but fortunately only key_create_or_update()
    uses it.  LSMs using the key_alloc hook don't check that flag.
    
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP is then ignored but fortunately (again) the root user cannot
    write to the blacklist keyring, so it is not possible to remove a key/hash
    from it.
    
    Fix this by adding a KEY_ALLOC_SET_KEEP flag that tells key_alloc() to set
    KEY_FLAG_KEEP on the new key.  blacklist_init() can then, correctly, pass
    this to keyring_alloc().
    
    We can also use this in ima_mok_init() rather than setting the flag
    manually.
    
    Note that this doesn't fix an observable bug with the current
    implementation but it is required to allow addition of new hashes to the
    blacklist in the future without making it possible for them to be removed.

    of/fdt: Make sure no-map does not remove already reserved regions
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a5a75e5e9e55de1cef5d83ca3589cb4899193ef ]
    
    If the device tree is incorrectly configured, and attempts to
    define a "no-map" reserved memory that overlaps with the kernel
    data/code, the kernel would crash quickly after boot, with no
    obvious clue about the nature of the issue.
    
    For example, this would happen if we have the kernel mapped at
    these addresses (from /proc/iomem):
    40000000-41ffffff : System RAM
      40080000-40dfffff : Kernel code
      40e00000-411fffff : reserved
      41200000-413e0fff : Kernel data
    
    And we declare a no-map shared-dma-pool region at a fixed address
    within that range:
    mem_reserved: mem_region {
            compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
            reg = <0 0x40000000 0 0x01A00000>;
            no-map;
    };
    
    To fix this, when removing memory regions at early boot (which is
    what "no-map" regions do), we need to make sure that the memory
    is not already reserved. If we do, __reserved_mem_reserve_reg
    will throw an error:
    [    0.000000] OF: fdt: Reserved memory: failed to reserve memory
       for node 'mem_region': base 0x0000000040000000, size 26 MiB
    and the code that will try to use the region should also fail,
    later on.
    
    We do not do anything for non-"no-map" regions, as memblock
    explicitly allows reserved regions to overlap, and the commit
    that this fixes removed the check for that precise reason.

    [ Upstream commit 035b73b2b3b2e074a56489a7bf84b6a8012c0e0d ]
    
    On Intel Tangier B0 and Anniedale the interrupt line, disregarding
    to have different numbers, is shared between HSU DMA and UART IPs.
    Thus on such SoCs we are expecting that IRQ handler is called in
    UART driver only. hsu_pci_irq was handling the spurious interrupt
    from HSU DMA by returning immediately. This wastes CPU time and
    since HSU DMA and HSU UART interrupt occur simultaneously they race
    to be handled causing delay to the HSU UART interrupt handling.
    Fix this by disabling the interrupt entirely.

    [ Upstream commit a0312af1f94d13800e63a7d0a66e563582e39aec ]
    
    Prevent invalid (0, 0) inputs to hid-core's snto32() function.
    
    Maybe it is just the dummy device here that is causing this, but
    there are hundreds of calls to snto32(0, 0). Having n (bits count)
    of 0 is causing the current UBSAN trap with a shift value of
    0xffffffff (-1, or n - 1 in this function).
    
    Either of the value to shift being 0 or the bits count being 0 can be
    handled by just returning 0 to the caller, avoiding the following
    complex shift + OR operations:
    
            return value & (1 << (n - 1)) ? value | (~0U << n) : value;

    ima: Free IMA measurement buffer after kexec syscall
    
    [ Upstream commit f31e3386a4e92ba6eda7328cb508462956c94c64 ]
    
    IMA allocates kernel virtual memory to carry forward the measurement
    list, from the current kernel to the next kernel on kexec system call,
    in ima_add_kexec_buffer() function.  This buffer is not freed before
    completing the kexec system call resulting in memory leak.
    
    Add ima_buffer field in "struct kimage" to store the virtual address
    of the buffer allocated for the IMA measurement list.
    Free the memory allocated for the IMA measurement list in
    kimage_file_post_load_cleanup() function.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Avoid use-after-free in vmbus_onoffer_rescind()
    
    [ Upstream commit e3fa4b747f085d2cda09bba0533b86fa76038635 ]
    
    When channel->device_obj is non-NULL, vmbus_onoffer_rescind() could
    invoke put_device(), that will eventually release the device and free
    the channel object (cf. vmbus_device_release()).  However, a pointer
    to the object is dereferenced again later to load the primary_channel.
    The use-after-free can be avoided by noticing that this load/check is
    redundant if device_obj is non-NULL: primary_channel must be NULL if
    device_obj is non-NULL, cf. vmbus_add_channel_work().

    separation like we need, we unfortunately lost the ability to control

    [ Upstream commit dc9455ffae02d7b7fb51ba1e007fffcb9dc5d890 ]
    
    The Renkforce RF AC4K 300 Action Cam 4K reports invalid bFormatIndex and
    bFrameIndex values when negotiating the video probe and commit controls.
    The UVC descriptors report a single supported format and frame size,
    with bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex both equal to 2, but the video probe
    and commit controls report bFormatIndex and bFrameIndex set to 1.
    
    The device otherwise operates correctly, but the driver rejects the
    values and fails the format try operation. Fix it by ignoring the
    invalid indices, and assuming that the format and frame requested by the
    driver are accepted by the device.

    MIPS: c-r4k: Fix section mismatch for loongson2_sc_init
    
    [ Upstream commit c58734eee6a2151ba033c0dcb31902c89e310374 ]
    
    When building with clang, the following section mismatch warning occurs:
    
    WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x24490): Section mismatch in
    reference from the function r4k_cache_init() to the function
    .init.text:loongson2_sc_init()
    
    This should have been fixed with commit ad4fddef5f23 ("mips: fix Section
    mismatch in reference") but it was missed. Remove the improper __init
    annotation like that commit did.

    crypto: sun4i-ss - fix kmap usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bc3dd24e7dccd50757db743a3635ad5b0497e6e ]
    
    With the recent kmap change, some tests which were conditional on
    CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM now are enabled by default.
    This permit to detect a problem in sun4i-ss usage of kmap.
    
    sun4i-ss uses two kmap via sg_miter (one for input, one for output), but
    using two kmap at the same time is hard:
    "the ordering has to be correct and with sg_miter that's probably hard to get
    right." (quoting Tlgx)
    
    So the easiest solution is to never have two sg_miter/kmap open at the same time.
    After each use of sg_miter, I store the current index, for being able to
    resume sg_miter to the right place.

    gma500: clean up error handling in init
    
    [ Upstream commit 15ccc39b3aab667c6fa131206f01f31bfbccdf6a ]
    
    The main problem with this error handling was that it didn't clean up if
    i2c_add_numbered_adapter() failed.  This code is pretty old, and doesn't
    match with today's checkpatch.pl standards so I took the opportunity to
    tidy it up a bit.  I changed the NULL comparison, and removed the
    WARNING message if kzalloc() fails and updated the label names.

    fbdev: aty: SPARC64 requires FB_ATY_CT
    
    [ Upstream commit c6c90c70db4d9a0989111d6b994d545659410f7a ]
    
    It looks like SPARC64 requires FB_ATY_CT to build without errors,
    so have FB_ATY select FB_ATY_CT if both SPARC64 and PCI are enabled
    instead of using "default y if SPARC64 && PCI", which is not strong
    enough to prevent build errors.
    
    As it currently is, FB_ATY_CT can be disabled, resulting in build
    errors:

    According to Errata #23 "The per-CPU GbE interrupt is limited to Core

    This is correctly checked for RSS configuration, but the initial queue
    mapping is still done by having the queues spread across all the CPUs in
    the system, both in the init path and in the cpu_hotplug path.

    net: amd-xgbe: Reset link when the link never comes back
    
    [ Upstream commit 84fe68eb67f9499309cffd97c1ba269de125ff14 ]
    
    Normally, auto negotiation and reconnect should be automatically done by
    the hardware. But there seems to be an issue where auto negotiation has
    to be restarted manually. This happens because of link training and so
    even though still connected to the partner the link never "comes back".
    This needs an auto-negotiation restart.
    
    Also, a change in xgbe-mdio is needed to get ethtool to recognize the
    link down and get the link change message. This change is only
    required in a backplane connection mode.

    The "REG_READ(ah, AR_PHY_AGC_CONTROL)" in ath9k_hw_loadnf() does not
    like being called when the hardware is asleep, leading to this crash.
    
    The easiest way to reproduce this is trying to set nf_override while
    the hardware is down:
    
      $ ip link set down dev wlan0
      $ echo "-85" > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/nf_override
    
    Fixing this crash by waking the hardware up before trying to set the
    noise floor. Similar to what other ath9k debugfs files do.
    
    Tested on a Lima board from 8devices, which has a QCA 4531 chipset.

    bpf_lru_list: Read double-checked variable once without lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 6df8fb83301d68ea0a0c0e1cbcc790fcc333ed12 ]
    
    For double-checked locking in bpf_common_lru_push_free(), node->type is
    read outside the critical section and then re-checked under the lock.
    However, concurrent writes to node->type result in data races.
    
    For example, the following concurrent access was observed by KCSAN:
    
      write to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10038 on cpu 1:
       __bpf_lru_node_move_in        kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:91
       __local_list_flush            kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:298
       ...
      read to 0xffff88801521bc22 of 1 bytes by task 10043 on cpu 0:
       bpf_common_lru_push_free      kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:507
       bpf_lru_push_free             kernel/bpf/bpf_lru_list.c:555
       ...
    
    Fix the data races where node->type is read outside the critical section
    (for double-checked locking) by marking the access with READ_ONCE() as
    well as ensuring the variable is only accessed once.

    staging: rtl8723bs: wifi_regd.c: Fix incorrect number of regulatory rules
    
    [ Upstream commit 61834c967a929f6b4b7fcb91f43fa225cc29aa19 ]
    
    The custom regulatory ruleset in the rtl8723bs driver lists an incorrect
    number of rules: one too many. This results in an out-of-bounds access,
    as detected by KASAN. This was possible thanks to the newly added support
    for KASAN on ARMv7.
    
    Fix this by filling in the correct number of rules given.

    usb: dwc2: Make "trimming xfer length" a debug message
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a9e38cabd80356ffb98c2c88fec528ea9644fd5 ]
    
    With some USB network adapters, such as DM96xx, the following message
    is seen for each maximum size receive packet.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state(): trimming xfer length
    
    This happens because the packet size requested by the driver is 1522
    bytes, wMaxPacketSize is 64, the dwc2 driver configures the chip to
    receive 24*64 = 1536 bytes, and the chip does indeed send more than
    1522 bytes of data. Since the event does not indicate an error condition,
    the message is just noise. Demote it to debug level.

    usb: dwc2: Abort transaction after errors with unknown reason
    
    [ Upstream commit f74b68c61cbc4b2245022fcce038509333d63f6f ]
    
    In some situations, the following error messages are reported.
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_hc_chhltd_intr_dma: Channel 1 - ChHltd set, but reason is unknown
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: hcint 0x00000002, intsts 0x04000021
    
    This is sometimes followed by:
    
    dwc2 ff540000.usb: dwc2_update_urb_state_abn(): trimming xfer length
    
    and then:
    
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at kernel/v4.19/drivers/usb/dwc2/hcd.c:2913
                            dwc2_assign_and_init_hc+0x98c/0x990
    
    The warning suggests that an odd buffer address is to be used for DMA.
    
    After an error is observed, the receive buffer may be full
    (urb->actual_length >= urb->length). However, the urb is still left in
    the queue unless three errors were observed in a row. When it is queued
    again, the dwc2 hcd code translates this into a 1-block transfer.
    If urb->actual_length (ie the total expected receive length) is not
    DMA-aligned, the buffer pointer programmed into the chip will be
    unaligned. This results in the observed warning.
    
    To solve the problem, abort input transactions after an error with
    unknown cause if the entire packet was already received. This may be
    a bit drastic, but we don't really know why the transfer was aborted
    even though the entire packet was received. Aborting the transfer in
    this situation is less risky than accepting a potentially corrupted
    packet.
    
    With this patch in place, the 'ChHltd set' and 'trimming xfer length'
    messages are still observed, but there are no more transfer attempts
    with odd buffer addresses.

    usb: dwc2: Do not update data length if it is 0 on inbound transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit 415fa1c7305dedbb345e2cc8ac91769bc1c83f1a ]
    
    The DWC2 documentation states that transfers with zero data length should
    set the number of packets to 1 and the transfer length to 0. This is not
    currently the case for inbound transfers: the transfer length is set to
    the maximum packet length. This can have adverse effects if the chip
    actually does transfer data as it is programmed to do. Follow chip
    documentation and keep the transfer length set to 0 in that situation.

    ARM: dts: Configure missing thermal interrupt for 4430
    
    [ Upstream commit 44f416879a442600b006ef7dec3a6dc98bcf59c6 ]
    
    We have gpio_86 wired internally to the bandgap thermal shutdown
    interrupt on 4430 like we have it on 4460 according to the TRM.
    This can be found easily by searching for TSHUT.
    
    For some reason the thermal shutdown interrupt was never added
    for 4430, let's add it. I believe this is needed for the thermal
    shutdown interrupt handler ti_bandgap_tshut_irq_handler() to call
    orderly_poweroff().

    usb: gadget: u_audio: Free requests only after callback
    
    [ Upstream commit 7de8681be2cde9f6953d3be1fa6ce05f9fe6e637 ]
    
    As per the kernel doc for usb_ep_dequeue(), it states that "this
    routine is asynchronous, that is, it may return before the completion
    routine runs". And indeed since v5.0 the dwc3 gadget driver updated
    its behavior to place dequeued requests on to a cancelled list to be
    given back later after the endpoint is stopped.
    
    The free_ep() was incorrectly assuming that a request was ready to
    be freed after calling dequeue which results in a use-after-free
    in dwc3 when it traverses its cancelled list. Fix this by moving
    the usb_ep_free_request() call to the callback itself in case the
    ep is disabled.

    MIPS: vmlinux.lds.S: add missing PAGE_ALIGNED_DATA() section
    
    commit 8ac7c87acdcac156670f9920c8acbd84308ff4b1 upstream.
    
    MIPS uses its own declaration of rwdata, and thus it should be kept
    in sync with the asm-generic one. Currently PAGE_ALIGNED_DATA() is
    missing from the linker script, which emits the following ld
    warnings:

    `.data..page_aligned' from `arch/mips/kernel/vdso.o' being placed

    `.data..page_aligned' from `arch/mips/vdso/vdso-image.o' being placed

    kdb: Make memory allocations more robust
    
    commit 93f7a6d818deef69d0ba652d46bae6fbabbf365c upstream.
    
    Currently kdb uses in_interrupt() to determine whether its library
    code has been called from the kgdb trap handler or from a saner calling
    context such as driver init. This approach is broken because
    in_interrupt() alone isn't able to determine kgdb trap handler entry from
    normal task context. This can happen during normal use of basic features
    such as breakpoints and can also be trivially reproduced using:
    echo g > /proc/sysrq-trigger
    
    We can improve this by adding check for in_dbg_master() instead which
    explicitly determines if we are running in debugger context.

    vmlinux.lds.h: add DWARF v5 sections
    
    commit 3c4fa46b30c551b1df2fb1574a684f68bc22067c upstream.
    
    We expect toolchains to produce these new debug info sections as part of
    DWARF v5. Add explicit placements to prevent the linker warnings from
    --orphan-section=warn.
    
    Compilers may produce such sections with explicit -gdwarf-5, or based on
    the implicit default version of DWARF when -g is used via DEBUG_INFO.
    This implicit default changes over time, and has changed to DWARF v5
    with GCC 11.
    
    .debug_sup was mentioned in review, but without compilers producing it
    today, let's wait to add it until it becomes necessary.

    cifs: Set CIFS_MOUNT_USE_PREFIX_PATH flag on setting cifs_sb->prepath.
    
    [ Upstream commit a738c93fb1c17e386a09304b517b1c6b2a6a5a8b ]
    
    While debugging another issue today, Steve and I noticed that if a
    subdir for a file share is already mounted on the client, any new
    mount of any other subdir (or the file share root) of the same share
    results in sharing the cifs superblock, which e.g. can result in
    incorrect device name.
    
    While setting prefix path for the root of a cifs_sb,
    CIFS_MOUNT_USE_PREFIX_PATH flag should also be set.
    Without it, prepath is not even considered in some places,

    arm64: tegra: Add power-domain for Tegra210 HDA
    
    commit 1e0ca5467445bc1f41a9e403d6161a22f313dae7 upstream.
    
    HDA initialization is failing occasionally on Tegra210 and following
    print is observed in the boot log. Because of this probe() fails and
    no sound card is registered.
    
      [16.800802] tegra-hda 70030000.hda: no codecs found!
    
    Codecs request a state change and enumeration by the controller. In
    failure cases this does not seem to happen as STATETS register reads 0.
    
    The problem seems to be related to the HDA codec dependency on SOR
    power domain. If it is gated during HDA probe then the failure is
    observed. Building Tegra HDA driver into kernel image avoids this
    failure but does not completely address the dependency part. Fix this
    problem by adding 'power-domains' DT property for Tegra210 HDA. Note
    that Tegra186 and Tegra194 HDA do this already.

    HID: make arrays usage and value to be the same
    
    commit ed9be64eefe26d7d8b0b5b9fa3ffdf425d87a01f upstream.
    
    The HID subsystem allows an "HID report field" to have a different
    number of "values" and "usages" when it is allocated. When a field
    struct is created, the size of the usage array is guaranteed to be at
    least as large as the values array, but it may be larger. This leads to
    a potential out-of-bounds write in
    __hidinput_change_resolution_multipliers() and an out-of-bounds read in
    hidinput_count_leds().
    
    To fix this, let's make sure that both the usage and value arrays are
    the same size.

    On a device like a cellphone which is constantly suspending
    and resuming CLOCK_MONOTONIC is not particularly useful for
    keeping track of or reacting to external network events.
    Instead you want to use CLOCK_BOOTTIME.
    
    Hence add bpf_ktime_get_boot_ns() as a mirror of bpf_ktime_get_ns()
    based around CLOCK_BOOTTIME instead of CLOCK_MONOTONIC.

    UPSTREAM: net: bpf: Make bpf_ktime_get_ns() available to non GPL programs
    
    The entire implementation is in kernel/bpf/helpers.c:
    
    BPF_CALL_0(bpf_ktime_get_ns) {
           /* NMI safe access to clock monotonic */
           return ktime_get_mono_fast_ns();
    }
    
    const struct bpf_func_proto bpf_ktime_get_ns_proto = {
           .func           = bpf_ktime_get_ns,
           .gpl_only       = false,
           .ret_type       = RET_INTEGER,
    };
    
    and this was presumably marked GPL due to kernel/time/timekeeping.c:
      EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(ktime_get_mono_fast_ns);
    
    and while that may make sense for kernel modules (although even that
    is doubtful), there is currently AFAICT no other source of time
    available to ebpf.
    
    Furthermore this is really just equivalent to clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
    which is exposed to userspace (via vdso even to make it performant)...
    
    As such, I see no reason to keep the GPL restriction.
    (In the future I'd like to have access to time from Apache licensed ebpf code)

    kvm: check tlbs_dirty directly
    
    commit 88bf56d04bc3564542049ec4ec168a8b60d0b48c upstream
    
    In kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start(), tlbs_dirty is used as:
            need_tlb_flush |= kvm->tlbs_dirty;
    with need_tlb_flush's type being int and tlbs_dirty's type being long.
    
    It means that tlbs_dirty is always used as int and the higher 32 bits
    is useless.  We need to check tlbs_dirty in a correct way and this
    change checks it directly without propagating it to need_tlb_flush.
    
    Note: it's _extremely_ unlikely this neglecting of higher 32 bits can
    cause problems in practice.  It would require encountering tlbs_dirty
    on a 4 billion count boundary, and KVM would need to be using shadow
    paging or be running a nested guest.

    usb: gadget: u_ether: Fix MTU size mismatch with RX packet size
    
    commit 0a88fa221ce911c331bf700d2214c5b2f77414d3 upstream
    
    Fix the MTU size issue with RX packet size as the host sends the packet
    with extra bytes containing ethernet header. This causes failure when
    user sets the MTU size to the maximum i.e. 15412. In this case the
    ethernet packet received will be of length 15412 plus the ethernet header
    length. This patch fixes the issue where there is a check that RX packet
    length must not be more than max packet length.

    xen-blkback: fix error handling in xen_blkbk_map()
    
    commit 871997bc9e423f05c7da7c9178e62dde5df2a7f8 upstream.
    
    The function uses a goto-based loop, which may lead to an earlier error
    getting discarded by a later iteration. Exit this ad-hoc loop when an
    error was encountered.
    
    The out-of-memory error path additionally fails to fill a structure
    field looked at by xen_blkbk_unmap_prepare() before inspecting the
    handle which does get properly set (to BLKBACK_INVALID_HANDLE).
    
    Since the earlier exiting from the ad-hoc loop requires the same field
    filling (invalidation) as that on the out-of-memory path, fold both
    paths. While doing so, drop the pr_alert(), as extra log messages aren't
    going to help the situation (the kernel will log oom conditions already
    anyway).
    
    This is XSA-365.

    xen-blkback: don't "handle" error by BUG()
    
    commit 5a264285ed1cd32e26d9de4f3c8c6855e467fd63 upstream.
    
    In particular -ENOMEM may come back here, from set_foreign_p2m_mapping().
    Don't make problems worse, the more that handling elsewhere (together
    with map's status fields now indicating whether a mapping wasn't even
    attempted, and hence has to be considered failed) doesn't require this
    odd way of dealing with errors.
    
    This is part of XSA-362.

    commit 36bf1dfb8b266e089afa9b7b984217f17027bf35 upstream.
    
    set_phys_to_machine can fail due to lack of memory, see the kzalloc call
    in arch/arm/xen/p2m.c:__set_phys_to_machine_multi.
    
    Don't ignore the potential return error in set_foreign_p2m_mapping,

    Xen/gntdev: correct error checking in gntdev_map_grant_pages()
    
    commit ebee0eab08594b2bd5db716288a4f1ae5936e9bc upstream.
    
    Failure of the kernel part of the mapping operation should also be
    indicated as an error to the caller, or else it may assume the
    respective kernel VA is okay to access.
    
    Furthermore gnttab_map_refs() failing still requires recording
    successfully mapped handles, so they can be unmapped subsequently. This
    in turn requires there to be a way to tell full hypercall failure from
    partial success - preset map_op status fields such that they won't
    "happen" to look as if the operation succeeded.
    
    Also again use GNTST_okay instead of implying its value (zero).
    
    This is part of XSA-361.

    Xen/gntdev: correct dev_bus_addr handling in gntdev_map_grant_pages()
    
    commit dbe5283605b3bc12ca45def09cc721a0a5c853a2 upstream.
    
    We may not skip setting the field in the unmap structure when
    GNTMAP_device_map is in use - such an unmap would fail to release the
    respective resources (a page ref in the hypervisor). Otoh the field
    doesn't need setting at all when GNTMAP_device_map is not in use.
    
    To record the value for unmapping, we also better don't use our local
    p2m: In particular after a subsequent change it may not have got updated
    for all the batch elements. Instead it can simply be taken from the
    respective map's results.
    
    We can additionally avoid playing this game altogether for the kernel
    part of the mappings in (x86) PV mode.
    
    This is part of XSA-361.

    Xen/x86: don't bail early from clear_foreign_p2m_mapping()
    
    commit a35f2ef3b7376bfd0a57f7844bd7454389aae1fc upstream.
    
    Its sibling (set_foreign_p2m_mapping()) as well as the sibling of its
    only caller (gnttab_map_refs()) don't clean up after themselves in case
    of error. Higher level callers are expected to do so. However, in order
    for that to really clean up any partially set up state, the operation
    should not terminate upon encountering an entry in unexpected state. It
    is particularly relevant to notice here that set_foreign_p2m_mapping()
    would skip setting up a p2m entry if its grant mapping failed, but it
    would continue to set up further p2m entries as long as their mappings
    succeeded.
    
    Arguably down the road set_foreign_p2m_mapping() may want its page state
    related WARN_ON() also converted to an error return.
    
    This is part of XSA-361.

    tracing: Avoid calling cc-option -mrecord-mcount for every Makefile
    
    commit 07d0408120216b60625c9a5b8012d1c3a907984d upstream.
    
    Currently if CONFIG_FTRACE_MCOUNT_RECORD is enabled -mrecord-mcount
    compiler flag support is tested for every Makefile.
    
    Top 4 cc-option usages:
        511 -mrecord-mcount
         11  -fno-stack-protector
          9 -Wno-override-init
          2 -fsched-pressure
    
    To address that move cc-option from scripts/Makefile.build to top Makefile
    and export CC_USING_RECORD_MCOUNT to be used in original place.
    
    While doing that also add -mrecord-mcount to CC_FLAGS_FTRACE (if gcc
    actually supports it).

    trace: Use -mcount-record for dynamic ftrace
    
    commit 96f60dfa5819a065bfdd2f2ba0df7d9cbce7f4dd upstream.
    
    gcc 5 supports a new -mcount-record option to generate ftrace
    tables directly. This avoids the need to run record_mcount
    manually.
    
    Use this option when available.
    
    So far doesn't use -mcount-nop, which also exists now.
    
    This is needed to make ftrace work with LTO because the
    normal record-mcount script doesn't run over the link
    time output.
    
    It should also improve build times slightly in the general
    case.

    vsock: fix locking in vsock_shutdown()
    
    commit 1c5fae9c9a092574398a17facc31c533791ef232 upstream.
    
    In vsock_shutdown() we touched some socket fields without holding the
    socket lock, such as 'state' and 'sk_flags'.
    
    Also, after the introduction of multi-transport, we are accessing
    'vsk->transport' in vsock_send_shutdown() without holding the lock
    and this call can be made while the connection is in progress, so
    the transport can change in the meantime.
    
    To avoid issues, we hold the socket lock when we enter in
    vsock_shutdown() and release it when we leave.
    
    Among the transports that implement the 'shutdown' callback, only
    hyperv_transport acquired the lock. Since the caller now holds it,
    we no longer take it.

    usb: dwc3: ulpi: Replace CPU-based busyloop with Protocol-based one
    
    commit fca3f138105727c3a22edda32d02f91ce1bf11c9 upstream
    
    Originally the procedure of the ULPI transaction finish detection has been
    developed as a simple busy-loop with just decrementing counter and no
    delays. It's wrong since on different systems the loop will take a
    different time to complete. So if the system bus and CPU are fast enough
    to overtake the ULPI bus and the companion PHY reaction, then we'll get to
    take a false timeout error. Fix this by converting the busy-loop procedure
    to take the standard bus speed, address value and the registers access
    mode into account for the busy-loop delay calculation.
    
    Here is the way the fix works. It's known that the ULPI bus is clocked
    with 60MHz signal. In accordance with [1] the ULPI bus protocol is created
    so to spend 5 and 6 clock periods for immediate register write and read
    operations respectively, and 6 and 7 clock periods - for the extended
    register writes and reads. Based on that we can easily pre-calculate the
    time which will be needed for the controller to perform a requested IO
    operation. Note we'll still preserve the attempts counter in case if the
    DWC USB3 controller has got some internals delays.

        October 20, 2004, pp. 30 - 36.

    netfilter: conntrack: skip identical origin tuple in same zone only
    
    [ Upstream commit 07998281c268592963e1cd623fe6ab0270b65ae4 ]
    
    The origin skip check needs to re-test the zone. Else, we might skip
    a colliding tuple in the reply direction.
    
    This only occurs when using 'directional zones' where origin tuples
    reside in different zones but the reply tuples share the same zone.
    
    This causes the new conntrack entry to be dropped at confirmation time
    because NAT clash resolution was elided.

    At the same time, the kernel image is protected with memblock_reserve(),
    so we can just start searching at PAGE_SIZE.  In this case the bottom-up
    allocation has the same chances to success as a top-down allocation, so
    there is no reason to fallback in the case of a failure.  All together it
    simplifies the logic.

    ARM: dts: lpc32xx: Revert set default clock rate of HCLK PLL
    
    [ Upstream commit 5638159f6d93b99ec9743ac7f65563fca3cf413d ]
    
    This reverts commit c17e9377aa81664d94b4f2102559fcf2a01ec8e7.
    
    The lpc32xx clock driver is not able to actually change the PLL rate as
    this would require reparenting ARM_CLK, DDRAM_CLK, PERIPH_CLK to SYSCLK,
    then stop the PLL, update the register, restart the PLL and wait for the
    PLL to lock and finally reparent ARM_CLK, DDRAM_CLK, PERIPH_CLK to HCLK
    PLL.
    
    Currently, the HCLK driver simply updates the registers but this has no
    real effect and all the clock rate calculation end up being wrong. This is
    especially annoying for the peripheral (e.g. UARTs, I2C, SPI).

    ovl: skip getxattr of security labels
    
    [ Upstream commit 03fedf93593c82538b18476d8c4f0e8f8435ea70 ]
    
    When inode has no listxattr op of its own (e.g. squashfs) vfs_listxattr
    calls the LSM inode_listsecurity hooks to list the xattrs that LSMs will
    intercept in inode_getxattr hooks.
    
    When selinux LSM is installed but not initialized, it will list the
    security.selinux xattr in inode_listsecurity, but will not intercept it
    in inode_getxattr.  This results in -ENODATA for a getxattr call for an
    xattr returned by listxattr.
    
    This situation was manifested as overlayfs failure to copy up lower
    files from squashfs when selinux is built-in but not initialized,
    because ovl_copy_xattr() iterates the lower inode xattrs by
    vfs_listxattr() and vfs_getxattr().
    
    ovl_copy_xattr() skips copy up of security labels that are indentified by
    inode_copy_up_xattr LSM hooks, but it does that after vfs_getxattr().
    Since we are not going to copy them, skip vfs_getxattr() of the security
    labels.

    cap: fix conversions on getxattr
    
    [ Upstream commit f2b00be488730522d0fb7a8a5de663febdcefe0a ]
    
    If a capability is stored on disk in v2 format cap_inode_getsecurity() will
    currently return in v2 format unconditionally.
    
    This is wrong: v2 cap should be equivalent to a v3 cap with zero rootid,
    and so the same conversions performed on it.
    
    If the rootid cannot be mapped, v3 is returned unconverted.  Fix this so
    that both v2 and v3 return -EOVERFLOW if the rootid (or the owner of the fs
    user namespace in case of v2) cannot be mapped into the current user
    namespace.

    platform/x86: hp-wmi: Disable tablet-mode reporting by default
    
    [ Upstream commit 67fbe02a5cebc3c653610f12e3c0424e58450153 ]
    
    Recently userspace has started making more use of SW_TABLET_MODE
    (when an input-dev reports this).
    
    Specifically recent GNOME3 versions will:
    
    1.  When SW_TABLET_MODE is reported and is reporting 0:
    1.1 Disable accelerometer-based screen auto-rotation
    1.2 Disable automatically showing the on-screen keyboard when a
        text-input field is focussed
    
    2.  When SW_TABLET_MODE is reported and is reporting 1:
    2.1 Ignore input-events from the builtin keyboard and touchpad
        (this is for 360° hinges style 2-in-1s where the keyboard and
         touchpads are accessible on the back of the tablet when folded
         into tablet-mode)
    
    This means that claiming to support SW_TABLET_MODE when it does not
    actually work / reports correct values has bad side-effects.
    
    The check in the hp-wmi code which is used to decide if the input-dev
    should claim SW_TABLET_MODE support, only checks if the
    HPWMI_HARDWARE_QUERY is supported. It does *not* check if the hardware
    actually is capable of reporting SW_TABLET_MODE.
    
    This leads to the hp-wmi input-dev claiming SW_TABLET_MODE support,
    while in reality it will always report 0 as SW_TABLET_MODE value.
    This has been seen on a "HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-cp0xxx" and
    this likely is the case on a whole lot of other HP models.
    
    This problem causes both auto-rotation and on-screen keyboard
    support to not work on affected x360 models.
    
    There is no easy fix for this, but since userspace expects
    SW_TABLET_MODE reporting to be reliable when advertised it is
    better to not claim/report SW_TABLET_MODE support at all, then
    to claim to support it while it does not work.
    
    To avoid the mentioned problems, add a new enable_tablet_mode_sw
    module-parameter which defaults to false.
    
    Note I've made this an int using the standard -1=auto, 0=off, 1=on
    triplett, with the hope that in the future we can come up with a
    better way to detect SW_TABLET_MODE support. ATM the default
    auto option just does the same as off.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix PCIe DT properties on rk3399
    
    [ Upstream commit 43f20b1c6140896916f4e91aacc166830a7ba849 ]
    
    It recently became apparent that the lack of a 'device_type = "pci"'
    in the PCIe root complex node for rk3399 is a violation of the PCI
    binding, as documented in IEEE Std 1275-1994. Changes to the kernel's
    parsing of the DT made such violation fatal, as drivers cannot
    probe the controller anymore.
    
    Add the missing property makes the PCIe node compliant. While we
    are at it, drop the pointless linux,pci-domain property, which only
    makes sense when there are multiple host bridges.

    arm/xen: Don't probe xenbus as part of an early initcall
    
    commit c4295ab0b485b8bc50d2264bcae2acd06f25caaf upstream.
    
    After Commit 3499ba8198cad ("xen: Fix event channel callback via
    INTX/GSI"), xenbus_probe() will be called too early on Arm. This will
    recent to a guest hang during boot.
    
    If the hang wasn't there, we would have ended up to call
    xenbus_probe() twice (the second time is in xenbus_probe_initcall()).
    
    We don't need to initialize xenbus_probe() early for Arm guest.
    Therefore, the call in xen_guest_init() is now removed.
    
    After this change, there is no more external caller for xenbus_probe().
    So the function is turned to a static one. Interestingly there were two
    prototypes for it.

    tracing: Check length before giving out the filter buffer
    
    commit b220c049d5196dd94d992dd2dc8cba1a5e6123bf upstream.
    
    When filters are used by trace events, a page is allocated on each CPU and
    used to copy the trace event fields to this page before writing to the ring
    buffer. The reason to use the filter and not write directly into the ring
    buffer is because a filter may discard the event and there's more overhead
    on discarding from the ring buffer than the extra copy.
    
    The problem here is that there is no check against the size being allocated
    when using this page. If an event asks for more than a page size while being
    filtered, it will get only a page, leading to the caller writing more that
    what was allocated.
    
    Check the length of the request, and if it is more than PAGE_SIZE minus the
    header default back to allocating from the ring buffer directly. The ring
    buffer may reject the event if its too big anyway, but it wont overflow.

    tracing: Do not count ftrace events in top level enable output
    
    commit 256cfdd6fdf70c6fcf0f7c8ddb0ebd73ce8f3bc9 upstream.
    
    The file /sys/kernel/tracing/events/enable is used to enable all events by
    echoing in "1", or disabling all events when echoing in "0". To know if all
    events are enabled, disabled, or some are enabled but not all of them,
    cating the file should show either "1" (all enabled), "0" (all disabled), or
    "X" (some enabled but not all of them). This works the same as the "enable"
    files in the individule system directories (like tracing/events/sched/enable).
    
    But when all events are enabled, the top level "enable" file shows "X". The
    reason is that its checking the "ftrace" events, which are special events
    that only exist for their format files. These include the format for the
    function tracer events, that are enabled when the function tracer is
    enabled, but not by the "enable" file. The check includes these events,
    which will always be disabled, and even though all true events are enabled,
    the top level "enable" file will show "X" instead of "1".
    
    To fix this, have the check test the event's flags to see if it has the
    "IGNORE_ENABLE" flag set, and if so, not test it.

    squashfs: add more sanity checks in xattr id lookup
    
    commit 506220d2ba21791314af569211ffd8870b8208fa upstream.
    
    Sysbot has reported a warning where a kmalloc() attempt exceeds the
    maximum limit.  This has been identified as corruption of the xattr_ids
    count when reading the xattr id lookup table.
    
    This patch adds a number of additional sanity checks to detect this
    corruption and others.
    
    1. It checks for a corrupted xattr index read from the inode.  This could
       be because the metadata block is uncompressed, or because the
       "compression" bit has been corrupted (turning a compressed block
       into an uncompressed block).  This would cause an out of bounds read.
    
    2. It checks against corruption of the xattr_ids count.  This can either
       lead to the above kmalloc failure, or a smaller than expected
       table to be read.
    
    3. It checks the contents of the index table for corruption.

    squashfs: add more sanity checks in inode lookup
    
    commit eabac19e40c095543def79cb6ffeb3a8588aaff4 upstream.
    
    Sysbot has reported an "slab-out-of-bounds read" error which has been
    identified as being caused by a corrupted "ino_num" value read from the
    inode.  This could be because the metadata block is uncompressed, or
    because the "compression" bit has been corrupted (turning a compressed
    block into an uncompressed block).
    
    This patch adds additional sanity checks to detect this, and the
    following corruption.
    
    1. It checks against corruption of the inodes count.  This can either
       lead to a larger table to be read, or a smaller than expected
       table to be read.
    
       In the case of a too large inodes count, this would often have been
       trapped by the existing sanity checks, but this patch introduces
       a more exact check, which can identify too small values.
    
    2. It checks the contents of the index table for corruption.

    memcg: fix a crash in wb_workfn when a device disappears
    
    [ Upstream commit 68f23b89067fdf187763e75a56087550624fdbee ]
    
    Without memcg, there is a one-to-one mapping between the bdi and
    bdi_writeback structures.  In this world, things are fairly
    straightforward; the first thing bdi_unregister() does is to shutdown
    the bdi_writeback structure (or wb), and part of that writeback ensures
    that no other work queued against the wb, and that the wb is fully
    drained.
    
    With memcg, however, there is a one-to-many relationship between the bdi
    and bdi_writeback structures; that is, there are multiple wb objects
    which can all point to a single bdi.  There is a refcount which prevents
    the bdi object from being released (and hence, unregistered).  So in
    theory, the bdi_unregister() *should* only get called once its refcount
    goes to zero (bdi_put will drop the refcount, and when it is zero,
    release_bdi gets called, which calls bdi_unregister).
    
    Unfortunately, del_gendisk() in block/gen_hd.c never got the memo about
    the Brave New memcg World, and calls bdi_unregister directly.  It does
    this without informing the file system, or the memcg code, or anything
    else.  This causes the root wb associated with the bdi to be
    unregistered, but none of the memcg-specific wb's are shutdown.  So when
    one of these wb's are woken up to do delayed work, they try to
    dereference their wb->bdi->dev to fetch the device name, but
    unfortunately bdi->dev is now NULL, thanks to the bdi_unregister()
    called by del_gendisk().  As a result, *boom*.
    
    Fortunately, it looks like the rest of the writeback path is perfectly
    happy with bdi->dev and bdi->owner being NULL, so the simplest fix is to
    create a bdi_dev_name() function which can handle bdi->dev being NULL.
    This also allows us to bulletproof the writeback tracepoints to prevent
    them from dereferencing a NULL pointer and crashing the kernel if one is
    tracing with memcg's enabled, and an iSCSI device dies or a USB storage
    stick is pulled.
    
    The most common way of triggering this will be hotremoval of a device
    while writeback with memcg enabled is going on.  It was triggering
    several times a day in a heavily loaded production environment.

    strings and zero the tail of the destination (if source string is
    shorter than destination buffer) but we do not have a function to do
    both at once.  This means developers must write this themselves if they
    desire this functionality.  This is a chore, and also leaves us open to
    off by one errors unnecessarily.
    
    Add a function that calls strscpy() then memset()s the tail to zero if
    the source string is shorter than the destination buffer.

    SUNRPC: Handle 0 length opaque XDR object data properly
    
    [ Upstream commit e4a7d1f7707eb44fd953a31dd59eff82009d879c ]
    
    When handling an auth_gss downcall, it's possible to get 0-length
    opaque object for the acceptor.  In the case of a 0-length XDR
    object, make sure simple_get_netobj() fills in dest->data = NULL,
    and does not continue to kmemdup() which will set
    dest->data = ZERO_SIZE_PTR for the acceptor.
    
    The trace event code can handle NULL but not ZERO_SIZE_PTR for a
    string, and so without this patch the rpcgss_context trace event
    will crash the kernel as follows:

    Remove duplicated helper functions to parse opaque XDR objects
    and place inside new file net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss_internal.h.
    In the new file carry the license and copyright from the source file
    net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c.  Finally, update the comment inside
    include/linux/sunrpc/xdr.h since lockd is not the only user of

    [ Upstream commit 7a21b1d4a728a483f07c638ccd8610d4b4f12684 ]
    
    If we get into a problem severe enough to attempt a reprobe,
    we schedule a worker to do that. However, if the problem gets
    more severe and the device is actually destroyed before this
    worker has a chance to run, we use a free device. Bump up the
    reference count of the device until the worker runs to avoid
    this situation.

    af_key: relax availability checks for skb size calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit afbc293add6466f8f3f0c3d944d85f53709c170f ]
    
    xfrm_probe_algs() probes kernel crypto modules and changes the
    availability of struct xfrm_algo_desc. But there is a small window
    where ealg->available and aalg->available get changed between
    count_ah_combs()/count_esp_combs() and dump_ah_combs()/dump_esp_combs(),
    in this case we may allocate a smaller skb but later put a larger
    amount of data and trigger the panic in skb_put().
    
    Fix this by relaxing the checks when counting the size, that is,
    skipping the test of ->available. We may waste some memory for a few
    of sizeof(struct sadb_comb), but it is still much better than a panic.

    The following mem abort is observed when the mba firmware size exceeds
    the allocated mba region. MBA firmware size is restricted to a maximum
    size of 1M and remaining memory region is used by modem debug policy
    firmware when available. Hence verify whether the MBA firmware size lies
    within the allocated memory region and is not greater than 1M before
    loading.

    fgraph: Initialize tracing_graph_pause at task creation
    
    commit 7e0a9220467dbcfdc5bc62825724f3e52e50ab31 upstream.
    
    On some archs, the idle task can call into cpu_suspend(). The cpu_suspend()
    will disable or pause function graph tracing, as there's some paths in
    bringing down the CPU that can have issues with its return address being
    modified. The task_struct structure has a "tracing_graph_pause" atomic
    counter, that when set to something other than zero, the function graph
    tracer will not modify the return address.
    
    The problem is that the tracing_graph_pause counter is initialized when the
    function graph tracer is enabled. This can corrupt the counter for the idle
    task if it is suspended in these architectures.
    
       CPU 1                                CPU 2
       -----                                -----
      do_idle()
        cpu_suspend()
          pause_graph_tracing()
              task_struct->tracing_graph_pause++ (0 -> 1)
    
                                    start_graph_tracing()
                                      for_each_online_cpu(cpu) {
                                        ftrace_graph_init_idle_task(cpu)
                                          task-struct->tracing_graph_pause = 0 (1 -> 0)
    
          unpause_graph_tracing()
              task_struct->tracing_graph_pause-- (0 -> -1)
    
    The above should have gone from 1 to zero, and enabled function graph
    tracing again. But instead, it is set to -1, which keeps it disabled.
    
    There's no reason that the field tracing_graph_pause on the task_struct can
    not be initialized at boot up.
